@R8 loads data at address = PRESENT as output.
@For the specified test case below, the PRESENT index is 6
@Hence, R8 holds 6 as output
@if SUBSTR is not present in STRING R8 holds 0x0

	MOV R3, R10                @R3 holds R10 addr so that load at loop label is from the correct 'next char of STRING' in the outer loop.
